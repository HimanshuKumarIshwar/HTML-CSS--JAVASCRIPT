            <li>A refrigerator is a common household appliance that is used to store perishable food at a low
                temperature, preserving its freshness and preventing spoilage. The purpose of a refrigerator is to keep
                the temperature inside the appliance low enough to inhibit the growth of bacteria and other
                microorganisms that can cause food to spoil.</li>
            <li>A static model of a refrigerator is a simplified representation of the system that is used to analyze
                and understand its behavior under different operating conditions. Static models do not take into account
                the time-varying nature of the system, but rather focus on the relationships between the variables at a
                specific point in time.</li>
            <li> Static models are commonly used in engineering and design to analyze and predict the behavior of a
                system without the need for complex and time-consuming simulations. They are useful for understanding
                the basic principles of a system and for identifying the key factors that influence its performance.
                Static models can also be used to optimize the design of a system by identifying the parameters that
                have the greatest impact on its performance.</li>
